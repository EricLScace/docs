# IPFS Gateway

This document discusses:
*   the several types of IPFS gateways;
*   their roles in use of IPFS;
*   appropriate situations for use of each type of gateway;
*   situations when you should avoid use of gateways;
*   implementation guidelines.

You should read this document if you want to:
*   understand, at a conceptual level, how gateways fit into the overall use of IPFS;
*   decide whether and what type of gateways to deploy for your use case;
*   understand how to develop and deploy gateways for your use case.

## 1. What is an IPFS gateway?

Errors occur when a browser that does not support IPFS attempts access to IPFS content in the canonical form of
```
ipfs://{contentID}
```
Other tools that rely solely on HTTP(S) (e.g., curl) encounter similar errors in accessing IPFS content in canonical form.

The end stage of IPFS deployment includes native support of IPFS in all popular browsers and tools.
In the interim, upgrading the browser/tool to support IPFS (e.g., through a browser extension) would resolve IPFS content access errors.

However not every user may be permitted to alter, or be capable of altering, their browser/tool configuration. IPFS gateways provide an HTTP(S)-based service for such browsers and tools to access IPFS content.

The canonical form of access to such IPFS gateways is:
```
https://{gatewayURL}/ipfs/{contentID}
```

## 2. Who provides IPFS gateways?

IPFS gateway providers include:
*   Protocol Labs, which deploys the public gateway ipfs.io;
*   Third-party private or public gateways; e.g., `https://cloudfare.com/ipfs`;
*   You, with a gateway installed as a local service on your machine e.g., `localhost:8080`.

Regardless of who deploys it and where, any IPFS gateway resolves access to any IPFS content ID requested via the canonical HTTP form described above.

## 3. What types of IPFS gateways exist?

The discussion above illustrated the use of read-only HTTP(S) gateways to fetch content. Other types of gateways exist as well:

| gateway type  | sub-type  | functional description    |
| -----------:  | :-------  | :--                       |
| HTTP          | readable  | Only retrieves content (HTTP GET method) |
|               | writeable | Allows data to be added to IPFS (HTTP POST, PUT, DELETE methods) |


<!-- Explain exceptions in Limitations section -->



<!-- So far the above only describes HTTP gateways. Add material for custom URL protocols; e.g., ipns://{peerID}/{path} and dweb://{ipfs address}. See https://docs-beta.ipfs.io/how-to/address-ipfs-on-web/#dweb-addressing-in-brief -->

<!-- How does it relate to the rest of IPFS -->


## 4. When should a gateway be provided, where, and which type of gateway?
<!-- Generic use cases -->
<!-- Which kind of gateway should be used when -->

## 5. When not to employ a gateway

### 5.1 Delay-sensitive applications
Any gateway introduces delay in completing desired actions.
Faster execution occurs when using methods at the top of the following list:
*   native IPFS node embedded within the app.
*   IPFS extension to app.
*   gateway installed as a local service on the app's machine, with redirection of requests
from app to the local service.
*   public/private gateways.

### 5.2 End-to-end cyptographic validation required
Because of third-party gateway vulnerabilities outlined in ยง6.1 below, apps requiring end-to-end validation of content read/write should avoid gateways when possible.
If the app must employ an extenal gateway, such apps should use ipfs.io or a trusted third-party.

## 6. Limitations

### 6.1 Third-party gateway security vulnerabilities
An IPFS node cryptographically validates content it fetches.
Employing a third-party public or private HTTP(S) gateway sacrifices end-to-end cryptographic validation of delivery of the correct content.
An inability to guarantee the proper behavior of such gateways undermines trust in fetched content.
The public gateway ipfs.io serves as an independent reference for returned content.

Similarly, guarantee of proper behavior when writing content via a third-party HTTP(S) writable gateway requires a fetch of written content via a native IPFS node or the ipfs.io public gateway.
